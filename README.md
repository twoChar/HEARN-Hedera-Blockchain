# 🔐 Blockchain-Based Asset Validation & Tokenization on Hedera

This project was developed for a client at **Hitachi America R&D** as part of a company-led initiative. The goal was to **digitize and tokenize large industrial components**—like those used in **oil mining machinery**—by converting them into blockchain-backed assets on the **Hedera Hashgraph** network.

We built a system that securely tracks these assets using **Solidity smart contracts**, **SHA-256 hashing**, and **ERC-721 token standards** for future-ready applications like asset transfers, ownership tracking, and on-chain validation.

## 🛠️ What This Project Does

Here’s how the system works, step by step:

1. **Transaction Data Encoding**
   - Each machine component’s key data (e.g., serial number, type, metadata) is collected from backend systems.
   - This data is then **converted into a SHA-256 hash** to keep it tamper-proof and anonymous before storing it on-chain.

2. **Smart Contracts on Hedera**
   - **Solidity smart contracts** deployed on the **Hedera Hashgraph network** receive and store these hashes.
   - Contracts act as a source of truth for asset verification and ownership status.

3. **Backend Integration**
   - Using **JavaScript**, I created services to interact with the smart contracts.
   - The backend (Node.js + SQL database) sends data via **RESTful APIs**, hashes it, and stores/retrieves it from both the database and the blockchain.

4. **Verification Process**
   - When needed, the stored hash is retrieved from Hedera.
   - The backend re-encodes the original data and compares the hashes to validate the asset’s integrity.
   - This ensures that no data was tampered with in transit or storage.

5. **Tokenization with ERC-721**
   - Implemented **ERC-721-based smart contracts** to mint NFTs that represent individual machine components.
   - These tokens can be used for tracking, transfer of ownership, or integrating with future marketplaces.

6. **Deployment**
   - The system was deployed on internal company servers to interact with Hedera in near real-time, enabling asset lifecycle tracking across systems.

## 💡 Real-World Use Case

This solution is designed for **industrial asset tokenization**—turning heavy equipment parts into secure, blockchain-backed tokens. This allows:

- Easy **ownership verification**
- **Tamper-proof audit logs**
- Streamlined **buying/selling of components**
- Integration with future **digital marketplaces**

It provides a solid foundation for building **supply chain traceability**, **digital twins**, or **maintenance tracking systems**.
